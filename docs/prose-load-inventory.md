# Prose-Load Inventory

> **Lifecycle:** WORKING DOC during execution → marked **POST-COMPRESSION ARCHIVE** in T9 → no maintenance owner thereafter.
>
> Durability lives in spec deltas `rq-proseReduction01`–`rq-proseReduction04`, not this file. This inventory is the audit trail for the compression passes (T2/T3/T4/T5) and the planning input for the asset-test audit (T1.5).

## Purpose

Every prose section across ADV instruction surfaces is classified into one of three enforcement classes:

| Class | Compression target |
|---|---|
| **full** | Pointer + constraint table (no paragraph) |
| **partial** | Pointer + constraint table + 1-line gap rationale |
| **inherent** | Structured table/checklist/template (no paragraphs) |

See `docs/command-voice-standard.md § Prose-Load Reduction Rules` for templates and stop condition.

## Scope

In scope:
- `ADV_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (817 lines)
- `docs/command-voice-standard.md` (706 lines, post-T0a)
- `.opencode/agents/adv.md` (371 lines)
- `.opencode/command/adv-*.md` (25 files, ~5,043 lines)
- `skills/*/SKILL.md` (6 files, ~845 lines)

Out of scope (constraints):
- `~/.config/opencode/instructions/*.md` — user-managed
- `plugin/src/index.ts PROVIDER_BEHAVIOR_HINTS` — provider variant patches
- Manifest descriptions — governed by separate drift test

## Classification Granularity

Inventory rows are at H2-section granularity. Within each section, T2/T3/T4/T5 decide paragraph-level compression guided by the assigned class. Critical Protocols (the largest H2 in `ADV_INSTRUCTIONS.md` at 295 lines) is broken out at H3 because its sub-sections span all three classes.

## Asset Test Audit (T1.5)

### Audit Methodology

Per KD4: every assertion in each `*-assets.test.ts` file is classified as:
- **prose-duplicating** — wording mirrors code-enforced behavior with no spec backing → safe to remove (UD4)
- **spec-enforcing** — backs an `rq-*` scenario → migrate or retain

### Audit Result Summary

**Conclusion:** Validator C1 was correct on the macro level. But mid-T2 user refinement clarified the criterion: distinguish **value-enforcing** assertions (must keep) from **heuristic drift** assertions (removable).

| Class | Definition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **value-enforcing** | Asserts specific anti-patterns, named citations, schema enums, config values, or canonical-list members. Loss = behavioral regression or spec-anchor loss. | KEEP |
| **heuristic drift** | Asserts heading exact-text, topic-presence (e.g., section discusses X), or paragraph-theme. Loss = no behavioral impact; assertion is just a "did the doc change?" tripwire. | REMOVE in T6 |

**Per-file value-vs-heuristic estimate** (sampled from `adv-autonomy-quality-assets.test.ts`, 138 expects):
- Value-enforcing: ~70% (~95 expects) — anti-patterns, named-7-checkpoints, verdict labels, config values, schema enums, escape-clause citations
- Heuristic drift: ~30% (~43 expects) — exact heading text, topic-coverage checks, vague regex matches like `[Vv]alid`

T6 removes the ~30% heuristic-drift assertions across all 13 asset test files (~165 of the ~545 total expects). T2-T5 must phrase-preserve only the ~70% value-enforcing portion.

### Per-File Audit

| Test File | Lines | Assertion Density | Backing Spec(s) | Dominant Class | Migration Plan | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `adv-autonomy-quality-assets.test.ts` | 414 | 138 expects | `rq-autonomy01.4` (post-approval auto-continue, doom-loop), `rq-remediation01` (validated in-scope), `rq-touchedScope01` (touched-scope ownership), design-validation requirements, cost-governance scenarios in advance-meta | spec-enforcing | **RETAIN** — compression passes preserve asserted phrases verbatim. Asserted phrases logged in §"Phrases to Preserve" below. | pending |
| `adv-checkpoint-assets.test.ts` | (45 expects) | spec-enforcing | `rq-cc01`–`rq-cc05` (checkpoint contract in advance-delivery) | spec-enforcing | **RETAIN** — checkpoint surface protected by separate drift test (`checkpoint-surface-drift.test.ts`); these asset assertions complement it. | pending |

### Phrases to Preserve (asserted by `adv-autonomy-quality-assets.test.ts` — VALUE only)

Compression passes preserve these phrases verbatim. Heuristic-drift heading checks (e.g., exact `### Human Checkpoints (Pause Required)`) are **NOT** in this list — they will be removed in T6 along with their assertions.

### Implication for T2/T3/T4/T5

Compression of these sections must be **phrase-preserving**: the surrounding paragraph prose can be removed/restructured, but the asserted phrases (heading text, exact strings, regex anchors) must remain intact within the compressed section. The compression templates in KD2 accommodate this — pointer + table format can carry asserted phrases as table values or bullet items within the section.

If a compression pass would unavoidably remove an asserted phrase, the affected section is excluded from that pass and re-classified `inherent` (kept in scannable structured form, no compression applied to the asserted lines).

### Implication for T6 (Asset-Test Cleanup)

Per UD4 ("remove prose-asserting asset tests"), the original intent assumed many assertions would be prose-duplicating. Audit shows nearly all are spec-enforcing. T6 scope is therefore **minimal removal**:
- Keep all spec-enforcing assertions in place
- The drift-test extension in T7 (line caps + code-path reference) supplements but does not replace the asset tests
- If any specific assertion is found to be redundant with T7's structural assertions during T6 execution, surface it as a judgment call rather than auto-removing

This honors UD4's spirit (eliminate prose-policing maintenance burden) while protecting spec enforcement (validator C1).

## Summary

| Class | Section count (approx) | Total lines | Pass owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| **full** (pointer + table) | 22 | ~700 | T2 (ADV_INSTR + adv.md), T3 (voice canon + commands) |
| **partial** (pointer + table + gap) | 18 | ~1,400 | T4 (all surfaces) |
| **inherent** (structured template) | 35 | ~1,800 | T5 (all surfaces) |
| frontmatter / out-of-scope | — | ~3,800 | n/a |

Total in-scope content: ~3,900 lines across ~75 sections. Compression target: pointer-line + table for `full` sections (typically 30→8 lines), pointer + table + gap for `partial` (typically 50→12 lines), structured template for `inherent` (typically 40→25 lines).

## Stop Condition (UD3)

Compression halts when no remaining row is classified `full` or `partial`. All remaining rows must be `inherent` (handled by re-templating, not compression).

The inventory table is the mechanical oracle for this — when its `full` and `partial` rows are all `Status: done`, T2/T3/T4 are complete. T5 then re-templates `inherent` rows.
