# Changelog

All notable changes to ADV (Advance) will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

#### Forward-Only Cleanup and Distribution Readiness

- Removed the retired `adv-research` command/spec/test surface from the repo and manifest.
- Deleted the dead 6→7 gate migration runtime and its dedicated tests.
- Removed stale investigation/exploration artifacts and consolidated setup guidance on `SETUP.md` by deleting `INSTALL.md`.
- Trimmed legacy/retired wording from operational docs and prompt files to reduce context noise.

#### Command Guidance Streamlining

- Simplified ADV command prompt files to reduce duplicated workflow prose while preserving the required execution contract.
- Strengthened core contracts for `plan`, `refine`, and `scout` agents to make roles and expectations more explicit.
- Added bundled methodology assets for `adv-apply` and `adv-prep`, plus a dedicated proposal checklist.

### Fixed

#### Upgrade Safety After Legacy Cleanup

- Added a one-time load migration in `plugin/src/storage/json.ts` that rewrites persisted gate entries with `status: "legacy"` to `status: "done"` before schema validation.
- Strip obsolete `migrated_from` and `absorbed_completions` gate fields during change loading so existing user state upgrades cleanly.
- Removed gate-level `legacy` status support from the active runtime/schema surface while preserving safe loading of older persisted data.

### Fixed

#### Harden ADV Compliance — TDD Evidence Validation and Execution Gate Guard

- **Added exit-code semantics validation for TDD evidence** — `adv_task_evidence` and `adv_run_test` now reject evidence where the exit code contradicts the declared phase (e.g., red phase with exitCode=0, green phase with exitCode≠0). `exitCode: undefined` remains allowed for backward compatibility.
- **Added execution-gate task-completion guard** — `adv_gate_complete` for the `execution` gate now verifies all non-cancelled tasks are `done` before completing. Previously the execution gate had zero checks and could complete with pending/in-progress tasks.
- New `plugin/src/validator/evidence.ts` — pure validation function `validateEvidenceSemantics()` shared by both evidence-recording tools.
- 18 new tests across 3 test files: 7 evidence validation unit tests, 7 tool integration tests (rejection + acceptance paths), 4 execution gate guard tests.

#### Skill Duplication — Trim Restated Checklist Content Across All Methodology Skills

- **Trimmed `skills/adv-discover-methodology/SKILL.md`** from 113→43 lines by removing per-step detail sections that duplicated `docs/checklists/discover-checklist.md`.
- **Trimmed `skills/adv-harden-methodology/SKILL.md`** from 85→37 lines by removing severity scoring, tech debt quadrant, status determination, minimum findings, and documentation hygiene sections that duplicated `docs/checklists/harden-checklist.md`.
- **Trimmed `skills/adv-review-methodology/SKILL.md`** from 71→55 lines by removing minimum findings threshold and verdict criteria sections that duplicated `docs/checklists/review-checklist.md`.
- All three skills now follow the canonical-source pattern: framework overview table + constraints only, with explicit deferral to their checklist for detailed rules.

### Improved

#### Discovery Phase Rigor — Enforce 9 Mandatory Protocol Steps in /adv-discover

- **Migrated orphaned Phase 1.5 (Skill Discovery)** from retired `/adv-research` reference into actual implementation in `/adv-discover`. The protocol was documented in `ADV_INSTRUCTIONS.md` but never implemented in the command file after the 7-gate workflow refactor.
- **Enhanced `/adv-discover`** (89→165 lines) with Phase 0 (methodology skill loading), Phase 1.5 (skill discovery), Phase 1.6 (conflict & related-work scan), Phase 1.7 (P25 related-pattern scan), and 11 required output sections including edge case investigation, design question depth, and draft spec delta shapes.
- **Created `skills/adv-discover-methodology/SKILL.md`** — reusable discovery protocol skill following the command+skill pattern from `rationalizeCommandVsSkill`.
- **Created `docs/checklists/discover-checklist.md`** — canonical checklist with 8 protocol steps, 13 edge case handling rules, and output section schema.
- **Created `.adv/specs/adv-discover/spec.json`** — new capability spec with 9 requirements (rq-disc01..09) encoding discovery rigor as enforceable law.
- **Updated `ADV_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** — moved `adv-discover` from command-only to command+skill list, corrected Phase 1.5 "Enabled" → "Implemented" with cross-references.

### Fixed

#### Gate Completion Instruction Audit — Ensure All Gate-Owning Commands Actually Complete Their Gates

- **`adv-proposal`**: Removed contradictory `× MUST NOT: complete gates` that prevented agents from calling `adv_gate_complete` for the command's own `proposal` gate. Changed to `complete non-owned gates`. Added explicit Step 9 with `adv_gate_complete changeId: ... gateId: proposal` call.
- **`adv-design`**: Added `complete non-owned gates` to MUST NOT for consistency with the pattern established by `adv-discover` and `adv-prep`.
- **`adv-accept`**: Added `complete non-owned gates` to MUST NOT for consistency.
- **`adv-task`**: Added missing `adv_gate_complete` calls for `proposal` and `design` gates. The command claimed to complete all 4 pre-implementation gates but only had explicit calls for `discovery` and `planning`.
- **`adv-review`**: Clarified ambiguous line 224 that could be misread as an instruction to call `adv_gate_complete`. Now explicitly states "× Do NOT call `adv_gate_complete` here" and marks the `completedBy` text as a hint for `/adv-accept`.
- **`ADV_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**: Updated command boundary summary table to match the corrected MUST NOT patterns in each command file.

### Added

#### Command + Skill Architecture for Review, Harden, and Slop Scan

- Added a documented "Command vs Skill Boundaries" policy to `ADV_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- Added bundled skills:
  - `skills/adv-review-methodology/SKILL.md`
  - `skills/adv-harden-methodology/SKILL.md`
  - `skills/adv-slop-detection/SKILL.md`
- Updated `/adv-review`, `/adv-harden`, and `/adv-slop-scan` to load backing skills with inline fallback
- Added asset tests covering bundled skills, command skill-loading, fallback text, and sync-global compatibility
- Updated `README.md` to describe the command + skill architecture and kept `SETUP.md` aligned with the new bundled skills

### Fixed

#### SQLite Cache Self-Healing for Status / Doctor Checks

- Reconciled the derived SQLite change/task cache against JSON source of truth during full change sync
- Auto-prunes stale SQLite change rows whose JSON source files no longer exist
- Auto-cleans dangling task and dependency references left behind by prior cache inconsistencies
- Added status regressions to ensure recoverable cache drift no longer persists as doctor warnings
- Documented that manual SQLite cache deletion is now a fallback, not the first-line recovery path

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-18

### Added

#### `adv_change_update` Tool — Prevent Duplicate Change Creation

- Added `adv_change_update` tool to update `proposal.md` and/or `problem-statement.md` for existing changes without creating duplicates
- Added `updateChangeArtifacts()` to storage layer with atomic writes
- Added `store.changes.updateArtifacts()` to Store interface
- Updated `/adv-proposal` (Step 7) and `/adv-research` (Phase 5) to use `adv_change_update` instead of re-calling `adv_change_create`
- 19 new tests across 3 architectural layers (storage, store, tool)

#### `/adv-harden` — Deployment & Operational Readiness Scanner

- Added Sub-Agent 6: Deployment & Operational Readiness Scanner to the hardening pass
- Covers 7 deployment dimensions: environment variables & secrets, database migrations, external service dependencies, CI/CD pipeline, infrastructure & runtime, feature flags & rollout, documentation & runbooks
- Outputs structured deployment steps (pre-deploy, post-deploy, rollback plan)
- Severity: destructive migrations without rollback and hardcoded secrets are BLOCKERs; missing env vars and unprovisioned services are HIGH
- Updated harden checklist from 5-scanner to 6-scanner coverage
- Updated final report template with Deployment Readiness dimension

#### Agent Tiering & Token Optimization

- Introduced three-tier agent classification: Core (always loaded), Common (always loaded), Specialist (repo-scoped)
- Core agents: `plan`, `build`, `refine`, `scout`, `orca` — available in all sessions
- Common agents: `explore`, `librarian`, `general`, `mechanic` — available in all sessions
- Specialist agents: `adv-researcher`, `tron` — repo-local, loaded only in ADV-enabled repos
- Removed 11 phantom agent registrations from `opencode.json` that were never spawned (consumed ~4-5k tokens with zero functional purpose)
- Measured agent payload with `tiktoken` (o200k_base): 11,862 tokens in ADV repos, 9,572 in non-ADV repos (down from 14,600)
- Added Agent Tiers table to `ADV_INSTRUCTIONS.md` documenting loading strategy

#### Prioritizer Skill Conversion

- Converted `prioritizer` from a global agent to an on-demand skill at `~/.config/opencode/skills/prioritizer/SKILL.md`
- Skill provides criteria question templates, decision map format, and research protocol — loaded only when needed via `skill("prioritizer")`
- Updated `orca.md`, `criteria-prioritizer.md`, `ADV_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `README.md`, and `SETUP.md` to reference the skill instead of the sub-agent

#### `sync-global.sh` — JSONC Config Support

- Config file resolution now matches OpenCode's own priority: `opencode.jsonc` > `opencode.json` > `config.json`
- Added `jsonc_to_json` helper that strips `//` and `/* */` comments before passing to `jq`
- Preserves URLs inside strings (e.g., `https://...`) during comment stripping
- Warns when `--fix` will strip comments from a JSONC file (creates backup first)
- New configs created by `--fix` use `.json` format for simplicity

### Fixed

#### `sync-global.sh` — Repo-Local Agent Leak

- Fixed sync script unconditionally copying repo-local agents (`adv-researcher.md`, `tron.md`) to global config, undoing agent tiering
- Added `REPO_LOCAL_ONLY` skip list to prevent repo-scoped agents from leaking into global
- Stale-removal logic now actively cleans leaked repo-local agents from global

#### `/adv-research` — Restored Sub-Agent Templates

- Restored over-compressed operational instructions lost in the 60% token reduction
- Restored librarian prompt template, adv-researcher prompt template, sub-agent failure detection criteria, inline fallback procedure, and explore agent fallback template

#### Miscellaneous Fixes

- Removed phantom tool names and fixed inconsistent MCP tool references across commands
- Restored conversation context for `/adv-proposal` and `/adv-task`
- Updated adv-researcher lgrep tool names
- Fixed CI build failure masking
- Synced pnpm lockfile overrides and pinned flatted to patched version
- Replaced silent `catch {}` blocks with `debugLog` calls in `plugin/src/index.ts`

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed

#### `/adv-apply` — Restore Autonomous Task Loop

- Phase 3 task flow now has an explicit `REPEAT/GOTO` loop construct with pseudocode, replacing the weak "continue with next ready task" language that was lost when `/adv-ralph` was consolidated
- Added whitelist of valid loop exit conditions (no ready tasks, doom loop, environmental blocker, user cancel)
- Added blacklist of invalid stop reasons ("completed one task", "made good progress", "context is getting long")
- Step 3e renamed to "LOOP CONTINUATION — MANDATORY" with explicit branching: tasks remain → go back to 3a; no tasks → Phase 4/5; all blocked → report
- Warning added that 3e is the most common point where agents incorrectly pause

### Added

#### `/adv-research` — Skill Discovery Phase

- Added Phase 1.5 (Skill Discovery) between Phase 1 (Analyze Target) and Phase 2 (Generate Research Questions)
- Scans global and project-local skill directories for SKILL.md files with `keywords` in YAML frontmatter
- Matches skill keywords against project tech stack and change domain terms
- Loads matching skills via `skill()` calls to provide domain-specific research guidance
- Graceful degradation: skills without frontmatter or keywords are silently skipped
- Added Skill Discovery Protocol section to `ADV_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for cross-command adoption
- Added reference `keywords` frontmatter to `skills/adv-tron/SKILL.md`

#### `/adv-apply` — Worktree Reuse and Overlap Detection

- Phase 0 Step 3 now detects existing worktrees for the target change via `git worktree list --porcelain`
- Healthy worktrees are offered for reuse; stale records (path deleted) are pruned automatically
- New Phase 0.5 checks for file overlaps with other active changes (advisory only, does not block)
- Overlap warning surfaces potential merge conflicts early with a `/adv-coordinate` suggestion

#### Worktree Documentation

- `ADV_INSTRUCTIONS.md`: added Worktree Reuse Protocol and Spec Divergence Rule sections
- `README.md`: added Worktree Integration section covering risk assessment, reuse detection, shared state, branch-local specs, and spec divergence
- `/adv-status`: worktree detection now shows worktree path for active changes that have one

### Fixed

#### `/adv-proposal` — Transcript Grounding

- `/adv-proposal` now extracts prior discussion context (agreed facts, decisions, rejected approaches, open questions, constraints) from the conversation **before** synthesizing a problem statement
- Problem Statement block now includes `PRIOR DECISIONS`, `REJECTED APPROACHES`, and `OPEN QUESTIONS` sections so the user can verify the agent faithfully carried forward what was discussed
- Confirmation step explicitly asks the user to check for drift, with a dedicated "Drift detected" option
- Phase 2 proposal template now includes a `## Constraints from Discussion` section that persists prior decisions and rejected approaches as binding constraints for downstream commands
- Anti-fabrication rule: the agent is explicitly instructed not to invent decisions or constraints that were not discussed
- Updated spec `rq-advprop02` from 3 to 5 scenarios covering extraction, grounding, drift detection, persistence, and abort

#### `scripts/sync-global.sh` — Config Validation and Patching

- `sync-global.sh` now validates `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` for required ADV entries (plugin path, instruction path)
- Added `--check` flag: report config issues without changing any files
- Added `--fix` flag: sync assets + auto-patch `opencode.json` to add missing ADV entries
- Default mode (no flags): sync assets + report config issues
- Config patching uses `jq` for safe JSON manipulation, backs up before patching, and is idempotent
- Handles tilde-expanded paths (`~/...`) and absolute paths when checking for existing entries
- Creates minimal `opencode.json` with ADV entries when the file does not exist
- Added 25 regression tests in `plugin/src/sync-global.test.ts`

### Added

#### `/adv-tron` — Codebase Reconnaissance

- Added `/adv-tron [target]` as a read-only reconnaissance command for broad repo scans and target-scoped investigation
- Added hidden `tron` sub-agent definition at `.opencode/agents/tron.md` for local codebase mapping, hotspot detection, and risk surfacing
- Added bundled skill `skills/adv-tron/SKILL.md` and extended `scripts/sync-global.sh` to sync ADV agents and skills into `~/.config/opencode/`
- Added focused regression coverage in `plugin/src/adv-tron-assets.test.ts` for command, agent, skill, and sync wiring

#### `/adv-harden` — Merge Compatibility Check

- Added non-destructive merge compatibility check to `/adv-harden` pre-flight
- Runs `git merge --no-commit --no-ff` against the default branch before quality scanners
- Blocks harden with conflict file list if merge would fail, so conflicts are caught early (not at archive time)
- Skips automatically when not in a worktree (already on default branch)

#### Worktree Context Propagation

- Added `{workdir}` propagation to sub-agent prompts in `/adv-audit`, `/adv-review`, `/adv-refactor`, and `/adv-slop-scan`
- Sub-agents now receive explicit `WORKING DIRECTORY` instructions so they read files from the correct worktree branch instead of the main repo root

### Changed

#### Tradeoff Questioning — Prioritizer Protocol

- ADV instructions now route multi-approach, tradeoff-driven decisions through the `prioritizer` sub-agent before asking the user questions
- The prioritizer drafts context-specific criteria questions plus a decision map so ADV agents can ask better tradeoff questions with less main-context overhead

#### `/adv-ralph` Consolidated into `/adv-apply`

- `/adv-ralph` has been removed. Its autonomous-retry behavior is now the default in `/adv-apply`.
- `/adv-apply` now includes: autonomous retry protocol (3 attempts with diagnosis), global final
  loop verification, error classification (SEMANTIC/TRANSIENT/ENVIRONMENTAL), completion modes
  (FULLY AUTONOMOUS / GUIDED / PARTIAL TAKEOVER), and the stricter no-skip/no-defer policy.
- Worktree threshold changed from 5+ files to **3+ files** (was the ralph default).
- **Migration**: Replace any references to `/adv-ralph` with `/adv-apply`. Behavior is identical.
- `adv-ralph` entry removed from `plugin/src/manifest.ts`; command count is now 19.

### Changed

#### Terminal Tab Title — Normalized Change Code

- Tab title now shows `<emoji> <normalized change code>` when a change is active (e.g. `🚀 Feature X`)
- Project name **dropped entirely** from the tab title — not needed as context
- When no active change, tab shows bare emoji only (e.g. `🌍`)
- Progress counter `[n/m]` removed — was broken and cluttered the title
- Change IDs are normalized to human-readable Title Case words:
  - `addFeatureX` → `Feature X`
  - `fixAuthTimeout` → `Auth Timeout`
  - `improve-terminal-tab-title` → `Terminal Tab Title`
  - Handles camelCase, kebab-case, and snake_case
  - Strips common verb prefixes: `add`, `fix`, `update`, `improve`, `create`, `remove`, `refactor`, `change`
- `normalizeChangeCode` and `buildTabTitle` exported from events module as public API
- **MOON emoji changed**: 🌙 → 📡 (satellite) — clearly conveys "sub-agents running" rather than "idle"
- README and ADV_INSTRUCTIONS updated with tab emoji column and title format documentation

### Fixed

#### Emoji Status Consistency

- Status emoji now driven by a single `resolveStatus()` function with explicit precedence:
  `MIC > MOON > TDD_RED > TDD_GREEN > ROCKET > EARTH`
- `🔴`/`🟢` (TDD_RED/TDD_GREEN) now actually appear — previously wired only in tests, never set at runtime
- `📡` (MOON) no longer stomped by `session.status busy/idle` events firing while a sub-agent runs
- `🎤` (MIC) from `permission.asked` correctly returns to `🚀` (ROCKET) after `permission.replied`
- TDD phase cleared on `session.status idle` — stale red/green can no longer linger after a tool completes
- Plugin state replaced scattered `setState({ status })` calls with `StatusFlags` interface + `setFlags()` helper

### Removed

- `detectStatusFromChange()` — dead code, never called from production paths
- `detectTddStatus()` — superseded by direct phase detection in `tool.execute.before`
- `updateProgressFromChange()` — dead code, never called from production paths
- Stale generated report files (`COMMAND_REPORT.html`, `COMMAND_REPORT.md`, `GOOST_VS_ADV_COMPARISON.html`)
- Unused `_getModelName` helper in `terminal.ts` (35 lines of speculative/dead code)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed (post-release)
- `/adv-quick` now always derives its contract from the recent conversation when called with no arguments — never asks "what do you want to build?"
- `/adv-proposal` no longer stops with a usage error when called with no summary argument — derives title from conversation context instead

### Added

#### `/adv-quick` — Fast-Track Contract Execution
- New command that turns a pre-discussed change into a fully-executed ADV change without the heavyweight proposal phase
- Synthesizes a **Quick Contract** from the conversation (intent, LBP targets, scope, success criteria)
- Chat-based confirmation via `question` tool — no file review required
- Autonomous pipeline: Research (LBP validation) → Prep (task generation) → Implement (full `/adv-ralph` behavior)
- **LBP halt condition**: pauses with options if a best-practice conflict is detected before writing any code
- Registered in command manifest with `gate: "implementation"`, successors `["adv-review", "adv-harden"]`

#### BMAD-Inspired Quality Infrastructure
- Adversarial review enforcement: minimum 3 non-nit findings or explicit genuinely-clean justification
- `docs/checklists/review-checklist.md` — 12-dimension review coverage checklist
- `docs/checklists/harden-checklist.md` — 6-scanner hardening checklist with severity scoring
- `docs/checklists/prep-checklist.md` — INVEST-based requirement specificity and scenario completeness criteria
- Project-level wisdom JSONL store (`wisdom.jsonl`) with add, list, compact operations
- `adv_wisdom_promote` tool to promote change-level entries to project wisdom with pruning criteria
- Project wisdom injected into session context as `[ADV:PROJECT_WISDOM]` (max 10 entries, newest first)

#### Worktree Integration
- Phase 0 worktree assessment in `/adv-apply` and `/adv-ralph` — risk-based suggestion with user confirmation
- Inline worktree protocol: create worktree, switch `workdir`, continue in same session
- External mutable state shared across all worktrees of the same repo via project-id (root commit SHA)
- Worktree cleanup protocol documented: archive ≠ merge, must verify merge before `worktree_delete`
- Graceful degradation when worktree tools unavailable (`[ADV:INFO]` marker, continues in-place)

#### Cross-Repo Task Routing
- Tasks with `target_repo` or `target_path` metadata execute in the target directory via `workdir` switching
- `related_repos` config in `project.json` for generic repo routing (id → absolute path)
- Prohibited cancellation reasons enforced: "different repo" and "out of scope" are invalid
- Cross-repo protocol documented in `/adv-ralph` and `/adv-apply`

#### Mandatory User-Approved Cancellation
- `adv_task_cancel` tool replacing direct `status: "cancelled"` via `adv_task_update` (now rejected)
- Per-task cancellation reasons required, batch approval supported via `question` tool
- Cancellation approval metadata (`approved_by_user: true`) tracked in `change.json`
- Review and Harden gates block if any cancelled task lacks approval

#### Typed Delta Modifications
- `modify` delta now type-checked against Requirement schema — unknown keys rejected at parse time
- `rename` operation: update title and/or ID of existing requirement
- Intra-delta conflict detection: rename + remove on same requirement, duplicate renames, ID collisions
- Delta application order enforced: rename → remove → modify → add

#### Tools
- `adv_task_show` — get full task details by task ID (includes parent changeId)
- `adv_run_test` — run test command and record TDD evidence in one call
- `adv_task_cancel` — cancel tasks with mandatory user approval and per-task reasons
- `adv_change_add_issue` / `adv_change_remove_issue` — link/unlink GitHub issue URLs to changes
- Wisdom tools: `adv_wisdom_add`, `adv_wisdom_list`, `adv_wisdom_promote`
- Gate tools: `adv_gate_status`, `adv_gate_complete`

#### Performance & Reliability
- Lazy sync on startup — reduced cold-start latency
- All 36 tools switched to compact JSON output with pagination support
- Auto-truncation on tool outputs to protect context window
- SQLite: WAL mode, auto-recovery, checkpointing to prevent corruption
- Atomic writes with fsync hardening for `change.json` and `agenda.jsonl`
- File locking to prevent concurrent write corruption
- Change IDs: camelCase format with stop-word filtering and auto-increment deduplication

#### Developer Experience
- `adv-researcher` sub-agent definition (`.opencode/agents/adv-researcher.md`)
- Bash policy guard (`plugin/src/guards/bash.ts`) enforcing read-only restrictions on `explore`/`librarian` agents
- JSON Schema generation script to prevent schema drift
- Migration script: add `$schema` refs to existing `change.json` / `spec.json` files
- Context freshness policy: re-read change via `adv_change_show` before each task (prevents drift)
- TodoWrite rules: task IDs only in todo list (forces `adv_task_show` lookup, prevents stale mental models)

### Changed
- `/adv-harden` doc scanner replaced with aggressive documentation hygiene (stale content detection, orphan files)
- `/adv-review` enforces minimum findings threshold with genuinely-clean justification template
- Change ID format: `camelCase` (e.g., `fixLoginBug`) with short-form partial matching
- `adv_task_update` rejects `status: "cancelled"` — use `adv_task_cancel` instead
- Archive workflow validates all 6 gates complete (or legacy) before proceeding
- Plugin context window optimized: reduced injected system context size

### Fixed
- Archive tests failing on Bun due to `access()` resolving to `null`
- `change.json` corruption under concurrent writes — strict locking + fsync
- SQLite corruption — WAL checkpointing and auto-recovery
- Bell/chime fires only on `ROCKET`/`MOON` → `EARTH`/`MIC` transitions (was firing spuriously)
- SQLite store now closes cleanly on session exit (memory leak)
- Schema errors returned to AI instead of silently logged to console
- `MOON` status preserved correctly during `session.status` events
- `$schema` field and extra fields in task/change schemas handled via `.passthrough()`

### Security
- Resolved 3 dependency vulnerabilities: `minimatch` (high ReDoS), `ajv` (moderate ReDoS), `esbuild` (moderate dev-server exposure)
- Updated `vitest` to v4, `tsup` to v8.5, `eslint` to v9.39, `typescript-eslint` to v8.56
- Added `overrides` in `package.json` to force patched `minimatch >=10.0.1` and `ajv >=8.17.1`
- Removed stale `pnpm-lock.yaml` (was being scanned by Dependabot instead of `bun.lock`)
- Migrated from `pnpm` to `bun` as primary package manager and test runner
