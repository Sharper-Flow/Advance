## ADV Overlay

- NEVER invoke `/adv-*` from inside ADV; execute ADV workflows inline with tools instead of slash-command dispatch
- Only the top-level orchestrator may spawn sub-agents
- Spawned workers must complete inline and must not spawn additional sub-agents; nesting depth is hard-limited to `1`
- Canonical TDD path is documented here only, not enforced here: use editing tools for test-file changes and `adv_run_test` for red/green; primary enforcement lives in plugin/runtime + spec.
