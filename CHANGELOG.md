# Changelog

All notable changes to ADV (Advance) will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-29

### Added

#### 6-Gate Quality Checklist
- Sequential quality gates: research, prep, implementation, review, harden, signoff
- Gate status tracking with timestamps and completion evidence
- Sequence enforcement - gates must be completed in order
- Auto-completion logic for research/prep gates in `/adv-apply` and `/adv-ralph`
- Gate prerequisite checks in `/adv-review` (requires implementation) and `/adv-harden` (requires review)
- User signoff gate required before archive

#### Gate Tools
- `adv_gate_status` - Get gate status for a change with completion timestamps
- `adv_gate_complete` - Mark a gate complete with sequence enforcement

#### Incremental Sync Optimization
- Triple-attribute file change detection (mtime + size + inode)
- `sync_files` SQLite table for tracking file attributes
- Skip unchanged files during sync for improved performance

#### Command Updates
- All workflow commands updated with gate integration
- Cancelled task approval flow via question tool
- Gate status displayed in completion banners
- Auto-completed gates notification in acceptance prompts

#### Migration Support
- Legacy gate status for existing changes (counts as "satisfied")
- Migration sets all gates to 'legacy' except signoff which stays 'pending'

### Changed
- Archive workflow requires all 6 gates complete (or legacy)
- Agenda completion checks gates if present

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-22

### Added

#### New Slash Commands (10)
- `/adv-clarify` - Requirements clarification assistant
- `/adv-prep` - Implementation preparation with analysis and planning
- `/adv-research` - Research context and generate ADRs for architectural decisions
- `/adv-review` - 4-agent parallel code review (Traceability, Logic, Security, Architecture)
- `/adv-harden` - 5-agent production hardening (Tests, AI-Slop, Docs, Cleanup, Spec Alignment)
- `/adv-audit` - Full system audit with staged analysis
- `/adv-ralph` - "Wreck-it Ralph" demolition protocol for removing capabilities
- `/adv-refactor` - Multi-agent refactoring with conflict detection
- `/adv-coordinate` - Multi-change coordination and dependency resolution
- `/adv-roadmap` - Strategic roadmap with change sequencing

#### Enhanced Commands (5)
- `/adv-status` - Enhanced with contract status display
- `/adv-proposal` - Hybrid architecture with tool-based state
- `/adv-validate` - Enhanced validation workflow
- `/adv-apply` - Full TDD workflow with contract banners
- `/adv-archive` - Complete archive workflow with validation

#### Documentation
- COMMAND_REPORT.md - Implementation details for all commands
- COMMAND_REPORT.html - Printable approval document

### Changed
- All commands now use hybrid architecture: tools for state, banners for visibility
- Commands derive CONTRACT banners from adv_* tool state instead of file parsing
- Sub-agent orchestration standardized across review, harden, audit, and refactor

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-21

### Added

#### Core Plugin
- Initial plugin scaffold with TypeScript configuration
- Zod schemas for runtime validation of all types
- Plugin lifecycle hooks (onSessionStart, onSessionEnd)

#### Storage Layer
- JSON file storage as source of truth for specs and changes
- SQLite caching with FTS5 for fast full-text search
- Unified Store interface combining JSON and SQLite
- Project configuration management (project.json)

#### Tools (13 total)
- **Spec Tools**: `adv_spec_list`, `adv_spec_show`, `adv_spec_search`
- **Change Tools**: `adv_change_list`, `adv_change_show`, `adv_change_create`, `adv_change_validate`, `adv_change_archive`
- **Task Tools**: `adv_task_list`, `adv_task_ready`, `adv_task_update`, `adv_task_add`
- **Status Tool**: `adv_status`

#### Validation Engine
- Completeness checks (tasks, deltas, scenarios, ID formats)
- Conflict detection (duplicates, orphans, priority downgrades)
- Reference validation (spec existence, requirement existence)
- "Specs as laws" enforcement

#### Archive System
- Delta application (add, modify, remove operations)
- Semantic version bumping (minor for adds, patch for modifications)
- Markdown documentation generation from specs
- Archive directory creation with change history

#### Events & Status
- Terminal status markers (`[ADV:ROCKET]`, `[ADV:TDD_RED]`, etc.)
- Tab color updates via OSC sequences
- Tmux environment detection and support
- Doom loop detection (3+ retry threshold)
- TDD phase detection from task titles

#### Slash Commands
- `/adv-status` - Project overview
- `/adv-proposal` - Create change proposal
- `/adv-validate` - Validate change against specs
- `/adv-apply` - Implement with TDD workflow
- `/adv-archive` - Archive completed change

#### Documentation
- ADV_INSTRUCTIONS.md - Complete agent guidance
- README.md - Project documentation
- INSTALL.md - Setup instructions
- Command documentation in .opencode/command/

#### Testing
- 222 tests across 11 test files
- Vitest test runner with parallel execution
- Temporary directory isolation for tests
- Sample fixtures (SAMPLE_SPEC, SAMPLE_CHANGE)

#### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions workflow for CI
- Multi-version Node.js testing (20.x, 22.x)
- Typecheck, lint, format, and test stages

### Technical Details

- **Runtime**: Node.js 20+
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Test Framework**: Vitest
- **Database**: better-sqlite3 with FTS5
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode + Zod schemas
- **Linting**: ESLint 9 with TypeScript support
- **Formatting**: Prettier
