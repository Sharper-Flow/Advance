# ADV Prep — Pre-Implementation Gap Analysis

Analyze change for gaps (missing scenarios, tasks, cross-cutting concerns) → add them via ADV tools. Uses 4-Step Gap Analysis and IEEE completeness criteria. Runs **inline** — no sub-agents.

## Command Boundary

**Produces:** Complete task graph via `adv_task_add` (sole pre-impl task creator), gap analysis, task sequencing with dependencies.
**× MUST NOT:** Complete non-planning gates, make new architecture decisions, modify problem statement/agreement/design intent.
**Gate:** Completes `planning` only. `/adv-task` is exempt (fast-track bundles proposal+discovery+design+planning).

## Target Resolution

1. If change-id provided → use directly
2. If empty → `adv_change_list` → auto-select the only plausible change; ask via `question` only if multiple plausible targets remain

---

## Phase 0: Load Skill

`skill("adv-prep-methodology")` → provides INVEST criteria, requirements smell detection, task sequencing (absorption, TDD ordering, dependency graph coherence), cross-cutting concerns checklist, and MoSCoW prioritization. If the skill is unavailable, use `docs/checklists/prep-checklist.md` as inline fallback.

---

## Phase 1: Load Context

`adv_change_show` + `adv_task_list` + `adv_gate_status` for target. Then `adv_spec action: "list"` + `adv_spec action: "show"` for each affected capability.

Stop if discovery or design gates are incomplete. `/adv-prep` analyzes validated design decisions — it must not backfill pre-implementation gates.

If change has tasks marked `done`, treat as draft implementation — run full gap analysis, add reconciliation tasks where gaps found. × Do NOT rubber-stamp completed tasks.

If zero tasks AND design gate complete → synthesize task graph from design findings, deltas, and proposal context. If design gate pending → warn: run `/adv-design` first.

Doctor-Lite: check cross-repo routing completeness — flag MUST gap if `target_repo`/`target_path` missing on cross-repo tasks.

---

## Phase 2: Gap Analysis + Task Synthesis

Run 4-Step Gap Analysis (desired state → current state → gap → action plan) using the loaded skill methodology:

1. **Requirements quality** — INVEST criteria + smell detection (from skill)
2. **Task sequencing** — absorption analysis, TDD ordering, dependency graph coherence (from skill)
3. **Cross-cutting concerns** — 12-item checklist, document N/A with rationale (from skill)
4. **Codebase impact** — search key terms, flag missing files/dependencies
5. **Cross-spec consistency** — `adv_spec search` for conflicts, terminology inconsistencies
6. **Cross-repo routing** — verify `related_repos` config, routing metadata, coverage

Prioritize gaps via MoSCoW. Emit CONTRACT ACTIVE banner. Proceed immediately — invocation is implicit approval.

Fix gaps: `adv_task_add` for missing tasks, `adv_task_cancel` (with approval) for absorption/merges, document N/A for non-applicable concerns. Assign `metadata.tdd_intent` to every task.

---

## Phase 3: Validation + Completion

`adv_change_validate strict: true` → fix errors → re-validate. `adv_gate_complete gateId: planning` → handle failure codes (`SCENARIO_MISSING`, `TASK_TDD_INVERSION`, `CROSS_REPO_MISSING_METADATA`).

Agent self-assesses readiness (requirements clarity, technical approach, edge cases). Resolve gaps inline or ask user.

Emit: `/adv-prep {change-id} COMPLETE` — gaps fixed, tasks created/absorbed/cancelled, gate status, next: `/adv-apply`.
